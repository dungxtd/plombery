Google Form processor script for hosting and scraping of Google Forms.

This script provides a processor object to handle the auto-processing of Google Forms.
The FormProcessor object simulates the Google Form website to perform scraping and auto-submission capabilities.

For more details on the functionality of this script, please view the documentation of the FormProcessor class.

This script works in tandem with handler.py to provide a user interface for users to submit Google Forms.
This script uses custom classes as representations of Google Form questions under the ./questions directory.
